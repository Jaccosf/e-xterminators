De Enschede. woman didn't stand a chance resuscitation was of no avail Many cyclists It is tragic, says Max Schulte, but he is not surprised Twenty years ago he already sounded the alarm at the municipality The Brinkstraat is dangerous for cyclists and should actually have a separate cycle path to have was his message at the time Schulte lives on Stroinkslanden Oost, many residents of the neighborhood cycle or drive on the Brinkstraat Children too Trial subscription N 4 weeks for 4 euros CONTINUE Stops automatically Offered by Or make it a traffic-free street where cars are guests, such as the Hoge Boekelerweg Max Schulte Schulte conducted a survey in the neighborhood and took the results to the municipality. The alderman then also promised something like a cycle path, but promises that are not on paper there is of no use to you. Another councilor came. Years passed and Brinkstraat remained more or less as it was. Almost nothing has changed. Nowadays there are a few false speed bumps and the speed has been reduced to 60 kilometers per hour. But the chicane just behind the viaduct still invites people to drive fast and the bends are unclear Local residents who were involved in the aftermath of the accident do not want to talk about it Schulte would rather not talk about it either, but he does it anyway I actually feel a bit obliged Because in those 21 years Little has changed. It is still a dangerous road for slow traffic. Girls go to riding school. Many children and students cycle from Stroinkslanden to the Bonhoeffer on Van der Waalslaan. And Holzik riding school is at the end of the road. Brinkstraat A lot of girls go there and girls always cycle three abreast h You don't do anything about that What makes the road dangerous is of course not the children but the driving behavior of motorists. Actually, you should narrow that down to the driving behavior of young men, says Schulte You should not rely on the proper behavior of road users. And the road itself does not help. From the city you still have a reasonable overview, but after the viaduct you cannot see what is coming in the bend. The accident took place near the viaduct. The driver of the car that towards the city ââdrove lost control News United Dennis Bakker All narrow roads What should be done according to Schulte A cycle path still Or make it a traffic-calmed street with car guests Like the Hoge Boekelerweg And let one car drive over that viaduct at a time Options Schulte thinks there are, but at the same time the Brinkstraat is an important traffic artery. A quarter of Enschede residents live in the southern neighborhoods and there are only four roads that provide access to the neighborhoods. That is far too few. But yes, Enschede. builds new neighborhoods and only then thinks about opening them up This corner of the city is extremely difficult, it is all narrow roads But I think a cycle path is feasible Driver has been interrogated The police are keeping mum about what exactly happened that Friday happened on the Brinkstraat. However, a spokesperson said that the driver of the car was arrested and interrogated. After that interrogation he was allowed to go home for the time being. The Forensic Traffic Investigation department of the police is investigating what exactly happened on the Brinkstraat. This will take a while. time The results will be sent to the Public Prosecution Service, which will then make a decision on possible prosecution of the motorist. No plans. In response to questions, the municipality states that there are currently no plans to further modify the Brinkstraat. The street will also not be on a list of roads known to be dangerous\n",

      "Translated Article: An unfortunate bicycle crossing on the Ekkerweijer in Best was partly the cause of an accident, according to lawyer Hendriks. The public prosecutor believes that the driver should have been more careful. Ronald Otter Scooter accident near Best is the fault of the cycle path DEN BOSCH An accident on Ekkersweijer in Best for a year and a half back was not the fault of scooter rider Fabio van A but of the cycle path. That has now been adjusted. Nevertheless, the Public Prosecution Service still wants a work sentence Max Steenberghe 25 08 20 Last update 26 08 20 Source ED March last year, Fabio 20 wanted to drop off his girlfriend in Eindhoven in the afternoon. They rode on his moped on the cycle path at Ekkersweijer, but at one point it crossed the road. Fabio did that too, but he had not seen it at all. that he drove next to a car that hit him hard Fabio got a concussion the girl broke her leg in three places and has still not recovered According to Fabio he did nothing wrong He was not driving too fast, had looked carefully in his mirrors and indicated direction. Nevertheless, the car came as if from nowhere. His girlfriend had not seen him at all. The driver tells a different story. He was overtaken on the right by the scooter and it crossed without looking back and without direction. point about Shark teeth on the road Public prosecutor Patrick van Hees thought the second version was more logical. That would mean that Fabio van A had driven too fast, but that had no influence on the accident. He had to slow down for a right-angle bend. But he clearly had the need a car see and have to give priority. This is evident from a traffic sign and shark teeth on the road. Meanwhile, the asphalt of the cycle path is no longer red at the intersection but has been blackened and there are still locks. Lawyer Monique Hendriks did not agree with this. It was a dangerous and very confusing stretch of road Because the cycle path was made of red asphalt and that also continued at the crossing Ten to one that cyclists think they have priority there. This was also evident from the large number of accidents. There were two fatal accidents in the past five years. one a few months ago And now the asphalt is no longer red but blackened and there are still locks. That may be possible. Officer Van Hees thought that may be the case, but above all it remains the responsibility of a driver to keep a good lookout. He demanded a community service order of eighty hours and a half year driving ban He keeps it conditional because Fabio needs his driver's license for his work\n",

      "Translated Article: Smartphone on the bicycle turned out to be fatal for Tommy Boy. I still think about him every day. Transport Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen wants an app ban for cyclists with effect from 2019. Michael Kulkens has been advocating for it for years. He lost his son Tommy Boy when he looked at his smartphone while on cycling was Marcia Nieuwenhuis 07 12 17 Last update 07 12 17 13 year old Tommy Boy was on the bike on August 22, 2015 on the way to Bussum when he looked up some songs on his phone for his sister's birthday. The boy was hit by a car and died from his injuries. Since that day, his father Michael Kulkens has been trying to protect others from the danger of smartphones in the traffic My son died two and a half years ago I have been working all that time to make texting in traffic a punishable offense. In addition to his work at Leen Bakker, Kulkens had about 15 Visited 000 students at schools to convince them that they should stop using their smartphones in traffic. What Veilig Verkeer Nederland does every year is something I do on my own. He says he puts in about 25 hours of his time every week. As a father who lost his son, I make a much more impression than a 21-year-old teacher who tells something about it. Michael Kulkens Marco Okhuizen Making decisions Even though he thinks it is good news that the new Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management Cora van Nieuwenhuizen is tackling this so energetically, it cannot happen fast enough for the now 48-year-old father. I hear that Minister Van Nieuwenhuizen was in favor of this from the start. I am happy about that, but I would prefer that decisions were simply made. From a letter that the minister sends to the House of Representatives today shows that the bill banning texting while cycling will not come into effect until 2019 at the earliest. Meanwhile, unfortunately, people and children continue to die from it, also due to the use of their mobile phone. Every day it is it takes longer to introduce this law, there is one too many, Kulkens continues firmly. I want to prevent the police from having to knock on parents' doors more often to report the loss of a child. Responsible When I hear the name Tom or when I see someone with a cell phone on the bike, then I'm in the middle of it again. In order to arrive at a responsible and robust solution, the minister first wants to consult with the Council of State, the government's advisory body and the highest administrative court in the country. Because her predecessor Minister Schultz in May 2016 After a conversation with Michael Kulkens, even though he announced that he would be investigating an app ban on cycling, he is disappointed that further research is now being called for. There are rough estimates that a mobile phone is involved approximately once a day accidents involving children on bicycles Meanwhile, the use of smartphones is only increasing Whether there are days when he does not think about his deceased son Tommy Boy I still think about it every day When I hear the name Tom or when I see someone with a cell phone on the bike, see I'm in the middle of it again But fortunately the thoughts of him do not always have to be negative. Also when I see Jackie Chan on TV, the kung fu hero of whom my son was a fan, I think of him. When I walk on the heath I think of my son. Saturday morning, for example, when he wasn't hurrying while he had to go to football\n",
