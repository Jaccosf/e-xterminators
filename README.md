The data scraping exists of one Jupyter notebook:
- [E-bike and regular bike scraping and cleaning](e-bike-scraping-json.ipynb)

Next to that, two csv files are present for the data scraping:
- [E-bike data](e-bike_articles.csv)
- [Regular bike data](bike_articles.csv)
- [E-bike data translated](etrans.csv)
- [Regular bike data translated](tradtransog.csv)

For the ML, four Jupyter notebooks are present:
- [Design Matrix & Aggregated Severity Score](DesignMatrix.ipynb)
- [Categorised Severity Score](Untitled.ipynb)
- [Severity Score & Time Series Analysis](TSMCSS.ipynb)
- [Time Series Analysis, Severity Score & Topic Modelling](NLP.ipynb)

And four csv files for aggregated data:
- [City e-bike](e_bike_city_severity_scores.csv)
- [City regular bike](bike_city_severity_scores.csv)
- [Province combined](province_severity_scores.csv)
- [Province combined + difference](updated_province_severity_scores.csv)

And, the roaddanger dataset in json:
- [Roaddanger data](roaddanger.json)
